**Module 13 Challenge**

**Mapping Earthquake**

**Overview:**

We worked on last 7 days of Earthquake data from USGS website. We tried to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates&#39; location on the earth, and also all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and then added the data on a third map.

We have three maps (tile layer):

- streets (default layer) (streets-b11)

- satelliteStreets (satellite-streets-v11)

- dark (dark-v10)

And we have three layers in the map:

- tectonicPlates

- allEarthquakes

- majorEQ

We have grabbed GeoJSON earthquake data for last 7 days and retrieved the data using GeoJSOn layer and add to map.

Similarly, we did for tectonic plates and greater than 4.5 magnitude data for the week.

At last we have added the third map tile layer.
